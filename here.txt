- Roadmap
    main -> will just execute
    objects -> all items
    player -> just the player
    scene -> handle what is going on the screen (may become state machine or something in the near future)
    map -> map generation, bliting (use a dummy till the world gen)
    program wise -> settings, configs etc
    server&client -> server and client side

- Miniscule stuff
    pygame.Surface.subsurface for spritesheet
